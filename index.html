          We welcome you to our retreat place which is located in a small
          mountain village called Amiras (around 550 mtr. high) at the south
          coast of Crete, the island of light..After living on Crete since 1986
          i was drawn to this area which has the quietness of the mountains and
          the vastness of the Libyan Sea just in front.of the house The energy
          is so pure , amazing and therefor perfect for yoga retreats , yoga
          holidays , Satsang or only a holiday . And maybe some questions about
          yourself and life will be answered.through the stillness of the place
          and the harmonic energy Around the retreat center you can hike in one
          of the only pine forests in Crete or relax on one of the most
          beautiful beaches i know of Crete all about 20 min away and driving
          through pure nature to get there.We have Minoan temples, gorges in the
          area.It is still like Crete many years ago with empty beaches and nice
          places to visit.. There are also some small villages for shopping etc
          and beautiful tavern's located along the seafront.Sunbeds and
          umbrellas are still provided for free in most places

            >You can relax here. Let the soul dangle and come back into harmony
            with what you really are.The place radiates a harmonizing and
            healing energy that our soul desperately needs in this hectic
            time..</span

          <h2>YOGA CLASSES</h2>
          <p>
            Close to the city center, the sandy beach of Koum Kapi and the Old
            Venetian Harbor we offer led and Mysore classes for practitioners
            that wish to continue as well as deepen their practice while on
            holiday. ​ Visitors from abroad are welcome to join our classes,
            also for those that would like to have a daily practice we can set
            it as a personal class while their staying in Chania. ​ A few words
            about our aproach on teaching. Our practice methods are based on the
            steps of Asthanga Yoga. Each method is adjusted to the practitioner
            in order for you to benefit as best as possible and not the other
            way round. Thus our practice of Yoga is feasible for all body types,
            level, period of life, age and anything else that someone could
            think that perhaps it might not make him/her suitable-for this
            program. We give emphasis on the method and quality of our breathing
            as this is the base of all Asanas, enhancing the energy flow within
            our body and mind. We wish to distinguish your individual needs and
            experience in order to inspire, advice and guide you as needed and
            help you come closer to your ideal personal practice, feel and
            listen to the lessons that your nature silently sends you, thus help
            you come closer to your self.
